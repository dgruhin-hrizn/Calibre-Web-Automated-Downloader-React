     --restart unless-stopped \
     ghcr.io/flaresolverr/flaresolverr:latest
   ```

2. **Configure Inkdrop to use FlareSolverr:**
   Add these environment variables to your configuration:
   ```bash
   USE_CF_BYPASS=true
   USING_EXTERNAL_BYPASSER=true
   EXT_BYPASSER_URL=http://localhost:8191
   EXT_BYPASSER_PATH=/v1
   EXT_BYPASSER_TIMEOUT=60000
   ```

3. **For Docker Compose setup:**
   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'
   services:
     flaresolverr:
       image: ghcr.io/flaresolverr/flaresolverr:latest

If you wish to enable authentication, you must set `CWA_DB_PATH` to point to Calibre-Web's `app.db`, in order to match the username and password.

If logging is enabld, log folder default location is `/var/log/cwa-book-downloader`
Available log levels: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`. Higher levels show fewer messages.

Note that if using TOR, the TZ will be calculated automatically based on IP.

#### Download Settings

| Variable               | Description                                               | Default Value                     |

| `PRIORITIZE_WELIB`     | When downloading, download from WELIB first instead of AA | `false`                           |

If you change `BOOK_LANGUAGE`, you can add multiple comma separated languages, such as `en,fr,ru` etc.  

#### AA 

| Variable               | Description                                               | Default Value                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `AA_BASE_URL`          | Base URL of Annas-Archive (could be changed for a proxy)  | `https://annas-archive.org`       |
| `USE_CF_BYPASS`        | Enable Cloudflare bypass (required for FlareSolverr)      | `true`                            |
| `USING_EXTERNAL_BYPASSER` | Use external bypasser service (FlareSolverr)           | `false`                           |

**üí° Recommendation**: For optimal performance and reliability, use FlareSolverr as an external bypasser service. See the [FlareSolverr Setup](#Ô∏è-flaresolverr-setup-recommended) section for configuration details.

If you are a donator on AA, you can use your Key in `AA_DONATOR_KEY` to speed up downloads and bypass the wait times.
If disabling the cloudflare bypass, you will be using alternative download hosts, such as libgen or z-lib, but they usually have a delay before getting the more recent books and their collection is not as big as aa's. But this setting should work for the majority of books.

#### Network Settings

| Variable               | Description                     | Default Value           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `AA_ADDITIONAL_URLS`   | Proxy URLs for AA (, separated) | ``                      |
| `HTTP_PROXY`           | HTTP proxy URL                  | ``                      |
| `HTTPS_PROXY`          | HTTPS proxy URL                 | ``                      |
| `CUSTOM_DNS`           | Custom DNS IP                   | ``                      |
| `USE_DOH`              | Use DNS over HTTPS              | `false`                 |

For proxy configuration, you can specify URLs in the following format:
```bash
# Basic proxy
HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080
HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080

# Proxy with authentication
HTTP_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080
HTTPS_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080
```


The `CUSTOM_DNS` setting supports two formats:

1. **Custom DNS Servers**: A comma-separated list of DNS server IP addresses
   - Example: `127.0.0.53,127.0.1.53` (useful for PiHole)
   - Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in the same string

2. **Preset DNS Providers**: Use one of these predefined options:
   - `google` - Google DNS
   - `quad9` - Quad9 DNS
   - `cloudflare` - Cloudflare DNS
   - `opendns` - OpenDNS

For users experiencing ISP-level website blocks (such as Virgin Media in the UK), using alternative DNS providers like Cloudflare may help bypass these restrictions

If a `CUSTOM_DNS` is specified from the preset providers, you can also set a `USE_DOH=true` to force using DNS over HTTPS,
which might also help in certain network situations. Note that only `google`, `quad9`, `cloudflare` and `opendns` are 
supported for now, and any other value in `CUSTOM_DNS` will make the `USE_DOH` flag ignored.

Try something like this :
```bash
CUSTOM_DNS=cloudflare
USE_DOH=true
```

#### Custom configuration

| Variable               | Description                                                 | Default Value           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `CUSTOM_SCRIPT`        | Path to an executable script that tuns after each download  | ``                      |

If `CUSTOM_SCRIPT` is set, it will be executed after each successful download but before the file is moved to the ingest directory. This allows for custom processing like format conversion or validation.

The script is called with the full path of the downloaded file as its argument. Important notes:
- The script must preserve the original filename for proper processing
- The file can be modified or even deleted if needed
- The file will be moved to `/cwa-book-ingest` after the script execution (if not deleted)

You can specify these configuration in this format :
```
environment:
  - CUSTOM_SCRIPT=/scripts/process-book.sh

volumes:
  - local/scripts/custom_script.sh:/scripts/process-book.sh
```

### Volume Configuration

```yaml
volumes:
  - /your/local/path:/cwa-book-ingest
  - /cwa/config/path/app.db:/auth/app.db:ro
```
**Note** - If your library volume is on a cifs share, you will get a "database locked" error until you add **nobrl** to your mount line in your fstab file. e.g. //192.168.1.1/Books /media/books cifs credentials=.smbcredentials,uid=1000,gid=1000,iocharset=utf8,**nobrl** - See https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated/issues/64#issuecomment-2712769777

Mount should align with your Calibre-Web-Automated ingest folder.

## Variants:

### üßÖ Tor Variant

This application also offers a variant that routes all its traffic through the Tor network. This can be useful for enhanced privacy or bypassing network restrictions.

To use the Tor variant:

1.  Get the Tor-specific docker-compose file:
    ```bash
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calibrain/calibre-web-automated-book-downloader/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.tor.yml
    ```
2.  Start the service using this file:
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.tor.yml up -d
    ```

**Important Considerations for Tor:**

*   **Capabilities:** This variant requires the `NET_ADMIN` and `NET_RAW` Docker capabilities to configure `iptables` for transparent Tor proxying.
*   **Timezone:** When running in Tor mode, the container will attempt to determine the timezone based on the Tor exit node's IP address and set it automatically. This will override the `TZ` environment variable if it is set.
*   **Network Settings:** Custom DNS, DoH, and HTTP(S) proxy settings (`CUSTOM_DNS`, `USE_DOH`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`) are ignored when using the Tor variant, as all traffic goes through Tor.

### External Cloudflare Resolver (FlareSolverr Integration)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note: For new installations, please refer to the [FlareSolverr Setup](#Ô∏è-flaresolverr-setup-recommended) section above for the recommended approach.**

This section covers the legacy external bypasser variant. The application can use an external service to bypass Cloudflare protection, instead of relying on the built-in bypasser. We strongly recommend [FlareSolverr](https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr) as the preferred external resolver, though it's also compatible with services like [ByParr](https://github.com/ThePhaseless/Byparr).

#### How it works:

- When enabled, all requests that require Cloudflare bypass are sent to your external resolver service.
- The application communicates with the resolver using its API.
- This approach can improve reliability and performance, especially if your external resolver is optimized or shared across multiple applications.

#### Configuration

| Variable               | Description                                                 | Default Value           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `EXT_BYPASSER_URL`     | The full URL of your external resolver (required)           |                         |
| `EXT_BYPASSER_PATH`    | API path for the resolver (usually `/v1`)                   | `/v1`                   |
| `EXT_BYPASSER_TIMEOUT` | Timeout for page loading (in milliseconds)                  | `60000`                 |

#### Important

This feature follows the same configuration of the built-in Cloudflare bypasser, so you should turn on the `USE_CF_BYPASS` configuration to enable it.

#### To use the External Cloudflare resolver variant:

1.  Get the extbp-specific docker-compose file:
    ```bash
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calibrain/calibre-web-automated-book-downloader/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.extbp.yml
    ```
2.  Start the service using this file:
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.extbp.yml up -d
    ```

#### Compatibility:
This feature is designed to work with any resolver that implements the `FlareSolverr` API schema, including `ByParr` and similar projects.

#### Benefits:

- Centralizes Cloudflare bypass logic for easier maintenance.
- Can leverage more powerful or distributed resolver infrastructure.
- Reduces load on the main application container.
